## Summary
### "Let's Walk to Lunch" allows users to find nearby lunch options based on current weather conditions. Users enter their workplace address. Current weather conditions are retrieved from WeatherUnderground, and are used to determine whether lunch today should be a longer walk (warm, sunny conditions) or a quick dash from the office (cold, rainy, or snowy conditions). Restaurants within an appropriate radius must be open for lunch, rated 3 stars or higher, and priced at $$ or less. All results are returned with their address, link to Yelp page, and plotted on a navigable map.
